This Python script is designed to analyze a log file containing entries related to the activities of cats entering and leaving a house. The script takes the path to the log file as a command-line argument. It employs a try-except block to handle potential errors during file reading, such as the file not being found or encountering other exceptions. The script then initializes variables for analysis, including counters for the number of correct entries by a cat named 'OURS,' the number of times other cats were doused with water, and cumulative time spent inside by the correct cat. The script iterates through the lines of the log file, processing each entry and updating the analysis variables accordingly. After processing all lines or encountering an 'END' marker, it calculates and prints various analysis results, such as the total number of correct entries, the number of doused cats, the total time spent inside (converted to hours), the average duration of correct visits, and the longest and shortest durations. Finally, in the main block, the script checks if the correct number of command-
line arguments is provided, prints a usage message if not, and calls the analyze_log function with the specified log file path if the arguments are correct.

THE OUTPUT WILL BE:
Log File Analysis

==================
Total number of times the correct cat has entered the house is: <correct_entry>

Number of times cats were doused with water: <doused_cats>

Total time spent in the house by the correct cat: <total_hours> hours

Average duration of each visit by the correct cat: <average> minutes

Duration of the longest visit by the correct cat: <maximum> minutes

Duration of the shortest visit by the correct cat: <minimum> minutes


------IF ARGUMENT IS MORE OR EQUAL TO 2:-----------

"Usage: python script.py <log_file_path>" WILL BE PRINTES

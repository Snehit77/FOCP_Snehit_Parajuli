This Python script is designed to analyze a log file containing entries related to the behavior of cats entering and leaving a house. The script takes the path to the log file as a command-line argument. It then reads the file, processes the entries, and performs various analyses. The key metrics include the total number of correct entries by a cat named 'OURS,' the number of times other cats were doused with water, the total time spent inside the house by the correct cat, the average duration of each visit, and the longest and shortest durations of visits. The script handles potential errors, such as file not found, and provides informative output summarizing the analyzed data. It is structured with functions for readability and follows best practices in exception handling.



The Output Will be:

Total number of times the correct cat has entered the house is: <correct_entry>

Number of times cats were doused with water: <doused_cats>

Total time spent in the house by the correct cat: <total_hours> hours

Average duration of each visit by the correct cat: <average> minutes

Duration of the longest visit by the correct cat: <maximum> minutes

Duration of the shortest visit by the correct cat: <minimum> minutes

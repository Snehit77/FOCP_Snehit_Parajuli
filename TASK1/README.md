This Python script functions as a pizza price calculator based on several input parameters. The user is prompted to input the number of pizzas desired, whether it is Tuesday, whether delivery is required, and whether the order is placed via an app. The price function calculates the total price considering factors such as the base pizza price, a discount on Tuesdays, additional delivery costs for small orders, and a discount for app orders. The script ensures user input validation, asking for correct answers if the input is invalid, and then computes the total price using the price function. Finally, it displays the total price with a formatted message. The code is well-structured, leveraging functions and input validation loops for user-friendly interactions and providing clear prompts and messages throughout the process.



The Output Will be:

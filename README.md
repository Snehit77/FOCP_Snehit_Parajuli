Task 1
=
This Python script functions as a pizza price calculator based on several input parameters. The user is prompted to input the number of pizzas desired, whether it is Tuesday, whether delivery is required, and whether the order is placed via an app. The price function calculates the total price considering factors such as the base pizza price, a discount on Tuesdays, additional delivery costs for small orders, and a discount for app orders. The script ensures user input validation, asking for correct answers if the input is invalid, and then computes the total price using the price function. Finally, it displays the total price with a formatted message. The code is well-structured, leveraging functions and input validation loops for user-friendly interactions and providing clear prompts and messages throughout the process.

The Output Will be:

BPP Pizza Price Calculator

==========================

How many pizzas would you like to order? 3

Is it Tuesday? y

Is delivery required? y

Did the customer use the app? n

Total Price: Â£39.00

Code is written to handle erroneous input.

Task 2
=
This Python script is designed to analyze a log file containing entries related to the activities of cats entering and leaving a house. The script takes the path to the log file as a command-line argument. It employs a try-except block to handle potential errors during file reading, such as the file not being found or encountering other exceptions. The script then initializes variables for analysis, including counters for the number of correct entries by a cat named 'OURS,' the number of times other cats were doused with water, and cumulative time spent inside by the correct cat. The script iterates through the lines of the log file, processing each entry and updating the analysis variables accordingly. After processing all lines or encountering an 'END' marker, it calculates and prints various analysis results, such as the total number of correct entries, the number of doused cats, the total time spent inside (converted to hours), the average duration of correct visits, and the longest and shortest durations. Finally, in the main block, the script checks if the correct number of command- line arguments is provided, prints a usage message if not, and calls the analyze_log function with the specified log file path if the arguments are correct.

THE OUTPUT WILL BE: Log File Analysis

================== Total number of times the correct cat has entered the house is: <correct_entry>

Number of times cats were doused with water: <doused_cats>

Total time spent in the house by the correct cat: <total_hours> hours

Average duration of each visit by the correct cat: minutes

Duration of the longest visit by the correct cat: minutes

Duration of the shortest visit by the correct cat: minutes

------IF ARGUMENT IS MORE OR EQUAL TO 2:-----------

"Usage: python script.py <log_file_path>" WILL BE PRINTED

TASK 3
=
adduser.py
=
This Python script defines a function add_user to add a new user entry to a file named 'passwd.txt' in a specific format (username:real_name:password). The script then prompts the user for input to create a new user by specifying a new username, real name, and password. It reads existing usernames from the 'passwd.txt' file and checks if the provided username already exists. If the username is found in the existing user list, it prints an error message. Otherwise, it calls the add_user function to append the new user information to the file and prints a confirmation message.

The script allows for the creation of new user entries while checking for duplicate usernames in the existing file. Note that the security of storing passwords in this manner is not recommended for actual use; it is better to use secure password hashing methods.

The output will be:

Enter new username: snehit123

Enter real name: Snehit parajuli

Enter password: psswd123

User Created.

deluser.py
=
This Python script defines a function delete_user to remove a user entry from a file named 'passwd.txt' based on the provided username. The script then prompts the user for input to delete a user by specifying the username. It reads all lines from the 'passwd.txt' file, writes back all lines excluding the one that starts with the specified username, effectively deleting that user's entry. It then prints a confirmation message, "User Deleted."

The script allows for the removal of a user entry from the file based on the specified username. Note that this script assumes that each line in 'passwd.txt' corresponds to a single user entry with the format "username:real_name:password." Also, it is worth noting that in a production environment, more secure methods and considerations should be taken into account for user management and password handling.

The output will be:

Enter username: snehit123

User Deleted.

login.py
=
This Python script defines a function login to check if a provided username and password match any user entries in a file named 'passwd.txt'. The script then prompts the user for input to log in, asking for a username and password. It calls the login function with the provided credentials and prints either "Access granted" or "Access denied" based on the function's result.

The login function reads each line in 'passwd.txt', splits it into fields using the ':' delimiter, and compares the provided username and password with those from the file. If a matching user is found, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

Note that this script assumes that each line in 'passwd.txt' corresponds to a single user entry with the format "username:real_name:password." Additionally, for secure password handling, it is recommended to use password hashing methods and consider other security measures in a production environment.

The outut will be:

User: snehit123

Password: psswd123

Access granted.

psswd.py
=
This Python script defines a function change_password to modify the password of a specified user in a file named 'passwd.txt'. The script then prompts the user for input to change a password, asking for the username, the current password, the new password, and a confirmation of the new password. It calls the change_password function with the provided credentials and prints either "Password changed" or "Passwords do not match. No change made."

The change_password function reads each line in 'passwd.txt', splits it into fields using the ':' delimiter, and checks if the provided username and current password match any user entries in the file. If a matching user is found, the function updates the password to the new one and prints "Password changed." If the new password and the confirmation do not match, it prints "Passwords do not match. No change made." The updated content is then written back to the file.

Note that this script assumes that each line in 'passwd.txt' corresponds to a single user entry with the format "username:real_name:password." Additionally, for secure password handling, it is recommended to use password hashing methods and consider other security measures in a production environment.

The output will be:

User: snehit123

Current Password: psswd123

New Password: snehit

Confirm: snehit

Password changed.
